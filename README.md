## About me

Note: Currently learning Git so I can upload useful code I've written over the last 14 years. --Chris, 04DEC2024

Oh, what do I say about me? Well, I’m a Navy Veteran, a nuclear physicist, a father and husband, and I fought a sea lion once. I like writing: code, novels, music…you name it. I helped found a non-profit that works with veterans to help them find satisfying work. Check out the Veteran Mentor Outreach Program at https://vetmentornetworkcom.wordpress.com/

- 🕘-🕔 Currently looking for work.
- 📓 PhD thesis: "Exploring the Neutron Substructure with Advanced Polarized Helium-3 Targets (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Spectroscopy)"
- 🌭 Favorite food: hot dog with all the fixings (cream cheese on a toasted bun, dill relish, ketchup, and either spicy brown mustard or Dijon)
- 🎼 I write music and play the guitar and drums.
- 📖 Currently working on a novel about a grief-stricken engineer who's unsure if the demigod that's tormenting her is real or if she's losing her mind.
- 🏆 I really did fight a sea lion once. When I was in the Navy, I was stationed on a submarine. The main ballast tanks have a valve topside that, when opened, let's the air out and submerges us. We put covers on them when we're in port to prevent accidentally diving. Also when we're in port, sea lions like to sun themselves topside as if the boat were a rock. We spray water near them to scare them away when we have work to do. Anyway, I was heading to the valve covers and this sea lion comes charging out of the water at me, barking ("arf arf arf", it's almost like a honk, I swear). I had a heevee line with me (rope with an orange ball on the end) and started swinging it over my head, honking back at him, and moving toward him. He turned around and went back to the water, bark/honking away. Probably one of the wierdest experiences of my life. Makes a fun story, though!
