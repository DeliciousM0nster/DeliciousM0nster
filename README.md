## About me

Oh, what do I say about me? Well, I’m a data scientist, trained experimental physicist (got me a piece of paper that says doctor and everything), Navy Veteran (submarines ONCE, submarines TWICE...), a father and husband, and I fought a sea lion once. Like, an actual sea lion (he started it). I like writing: code, novels, music…you name it. I miss seeing the Olympic mountains in the background and am currently satiating myself with views of the Shenendoahs. I don't care for sports, but will always root for the Vols because their fans are awesome (and I want those folks to be happy).

- 🕘-🕔 Currently looking for work.
- 📓 PhD thesis: "Exploring the Neutron Substructure with Advanced Polarized Helium-3 Targets (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Spectroscopy)"
- 🌭 Favorite food: hot dog with all the fixings (cream cheese on a toasted bun, dill relish, ketchup, and either spicy brown mustard or Dijon)
- 🎼 I write music and play the guitar and drums.
- 📖 Currently working on a novel about a grief-stricken engineer who's unsure if the demigod that's tormenting her is real or if she's losing her mind.
- 🏆 I really did fight a sea lion once. When I was in the Navy, I was stationed on a submarine. The main ballast tanks have a valve topside that, when opened, let's the air out and submerges us. We put covers on them when we're in port to prevent accidentally diving. Also when we're in port, sea lions like to sun themselves topside as if the boat were a rock. We spray water near them to scare them away when we have work to do. Anyway, I was heading to the valve covers and this sea lion comes charging out of the water at me, barking ("arf arf arf", it's almost like a honk, I swear). I had a heevee line with me (rope with an orange ball on the end) and started swinging it over my head, honking back at him, and moving toward him. He turned around and went back to the water, bark/honking away. Probably one of the wierdest experiences of my life. Makes a fun story, though!

Current Projects (what I'm teaching myself and the project I'm learning these skills for):
- Learning webscraping so I can write a very rudimentary search engine that targets niche sites (ex. you're building a guitar and want to find what type of capacitor to use and know the right answer is on one of these n number of sites you usually skim)
- Learning modern AI and ML algorithms because I was apparently writing rudimentary AI algorithms in some of my analysis code from my PhD work.
- Learning about UI and GUI, Docker, etc so I can write my daughter a program to help her practice math.
